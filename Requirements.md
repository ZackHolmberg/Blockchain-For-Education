# Course Blockchain Application Requirements

## COMP 2140

- Met with Dr. Cuneyt Ackora

- Must be a Java program

- Any code that is developed should be more or less "plug and play" as early second year students should not be required to worry about setup

- Candidate 2140 topics for blockchain application include:
  - Hashing
    - Minimizing collision
    - Working with hashing within the chain, utilizing it as a hash example, possibly creating a simple hash function
  - Linked lists
    - Blockchain is essentially a linked list. Can use blockchain as a "cool" example for teaching linked lists.
    - Bloom filters could be used to teach searching linked lists/the chain.
  - Trees
    - Merkle Trees could be used to teach Tree Data Structures and/or hashing, as it has great applications to both topics.
  - world
  - how
  - are
  - you

## COMP 3010

- Met with Michael Zapp and Robert Guderian

- Key high-level takeaways include encouragement to define requirements independently from any implementation and to view blockchain as the tool that I am using to teach bigger-picture fundamentals and lessons

- Candidate 3010 topics for blockchain application include:
  - Error handling
    - Peer-to-peer can be used to teach error handling
    - Students can identify error conditiions
  - Can use the chain to provide students with the opportunity to write/debug code alongside others working on the same code (live debugging/error handling)
  - Important to find the line/distinguish between what will be provided to students and what will be left for students to figure out
  - Implement election/consensus algorithm
  - Implementing byzantine is likely out of scope but lecture material may be created that reference blockchain technology that students may have already used in the course
  - Approximation algorithms
  - Continuous building/iteration over the duration of the course on more or less the same code base/framework that students iterate on through different assignments that each cover a different topic/different componenet of the blockchain
